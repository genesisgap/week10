This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Movie App Development.

Project Overview:

This project is focused on developing a fully functional movie app using Next.js and React. The app will showcase a list of movies with key details such as the title, epilogue, category, type, actors, and movie classification. Users can search for movies, filter by categories or actors, and interact with the movies by liking them or adding them to a watch later list. The app will also provide links to movie trailers on YouTube.

•	Search Functionality: Users can search for movies by title, category, and actors.
•	Filter Movies: Filter movies based on categories or actors.
•	Like & Watch Later: Users can like movies and add them to a watch later list.
•	Dynamic Movie Details: Navigate to a detailed movie view with comprehensive information.
•	Movie Trailer Links: Links to movie trailers on YouTube.
•	State Management: Use of Context API for managing state across the app.
